                An estimated 70 million people have criminal records in our country -- that’s 1 in 3 Americans. 
                A criminal record can have life-altering consequences beyond the incident itself. 
                It may be difficult to find and keep a job, secure housing, obtain a student loan, 
                or even volunteer in your child’s school. Collectively, we call these collateral consequences, 
                or legal restrictions imposed upon people because of their record.

                        In 2018, the US Dept of Justice and  American Bar Association found there are 45,000 
                        collateral consequences nationally.
